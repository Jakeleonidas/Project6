This is the second part of the BeReal clone project where you will add persistence and some cool BeReal functionality to the app.

Users are able to use the back camera to take a photo and upload it to the server OR user uploads unique photo from photo album
Users are not able to see other users’ photos until they upload their own.
Fetch the most recent photos within the last 24 hours from the server. - 
Of those returned in the response, only show the post if the createdAt property is within 24 hours of the logged in user’s last post. - 
You can either obstruct the photo (see blurred photo in stretch goals) or just not show it to the user.
